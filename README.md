## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/organica.git
   cd organica
   ```

2. Set up the database:

   - Create a MySQL database and configure the connection details in `backend/src/main/resources/application.properties` file. 

3. Application Properties

   To configure the application properties, follow these steps:

   - Open the `backend/src/main/resources/application.properties` file.

   - Configure the MySQL database connection properties by updating the following lines:

     ```
     spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/organica
     spring.datasource.username=your-username
     spring.datasource.password=your-password
     ```

     Replace `your-username` and `your-password` with your MySQL database credentials.

  
   - (Optional) If you want to change the server port, update the following line:

     ```
     server.port=8080
     ```

     Replace `8080` with the desired port number.

   - Save the `application.properties` file.

4. Backend Setup:

   - Navigate to the `Server` directory:

     ```shell
     cd server
     ```

   - Build and run the Spring Boot application:

     ```shell
     ./mvnw spring-boot:run
     ```

   The backend server should now be running on `http://localhost:8080`.

5. Frontend Setup:

   - Navigate to the `Client` directory:

     ```shell
     cd Client
     ```

   - Install the dependencies:

     ```shell
     npm install
     ```

   - Start the React development server:

     ```shell
     npm start
     ```

   The frontend server should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

6. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to access the Organica application.
